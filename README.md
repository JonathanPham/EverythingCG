# EverythingCG
Knowledge hub to share and learn the state-of-the-art developments in computer graphics.

Computer Graphics being a very inter-disciplinary field can be handled from different perspectives, this is an initiative to conglomerate all the information in computer graphics divided into 3 main sub-topics - art, design and technology.

The aim of this repository is to share the latest developments in this field in terms of - research papers, major tools, job opportunities, top universities, active professors and researchers. The main objective is to have a centralized platform where people can contribute content for others to learn. It is an initiative to foster learning and development of computer graphics. Please note that this is just a repository re-directing to works of other creators across the world and I was not part of any of the works.

All the information shared in this repository will also be curated and shared as part of my website - https://everythingcg.com/
